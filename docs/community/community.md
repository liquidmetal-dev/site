# Community

Hello, hello, hello :sparkles:

Welcome to the Liquid Metal Project!

If you are here reading this page then it means you are or want to become part of
the project community. That's cool :sunglasses:.

There are many ways to get involved, and a good first step is to join us on [Slack][slack].
If you need help, head to the [user support](/docs/community/support) page.

Not sure what you can bring to the table? Here is a list of some ways you can become
part of Liquid Metal:

- Use the product! And then tell us about it! User feedback is very important to us.
  We will use this to guide new features and solve bugs.
- Review this website! These docs are brand spanking new which means the tutorials may
  only work on [Claudia][cb]'s computer :scream:. We are keen for anyone to have a read,
  make suggestions, run commands, etc. Issues can be opened [here][site-gh].
- Contribute to [this website][site-gh]! We want to make the docs as flawless as possible
  for our community, and good docs take serious effort.
- Become active in [Slack][slack] and answer questions posted by others in the community.
- [Write some code](/docs/community/contributing) for one of the many repos which
  make up and support the Liquid Metal project.
- Come to [community meetings][meeting] to discuss progress and new ideas.

... and much more. The Liquid Metal project has a lot of moving parts and we encourage
everyone to dig in and find something, big or small, which interests them.
We are also keen to elevate regular and trusted contributors to maintainers.
