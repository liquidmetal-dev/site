# Contact

To reach out to team members in order to report a [Code of Conduct](/docs/community/coc) issue,
see the [team list](/docs/community/team).

For all other discussions **please do not reach out to individual team members**
but engage the project community as a whole by using Slack or tagging us on Github.

## Slack

We use slack to chat to users, post updates about releases, and coordinate with
contributors. You can join our channel [here][slack].

## Community Meetings

Community meetings are held every 4 weeks on Mondays at 4pm UTC.

To attend the meetings, first join the [liquid-metal-contributors google group][group].
You will then be able to see the [group calendar event][event].

You can check out [agenda and meeting notes][agenda] ahead of time, and please
feel free to add your name and any items to discuss!

## Github

To join discussions, comment on issues, or ask for help, please go to the relevant
repo in our [github org][gh].
